## 🌟 Getting Started

**aws-terraform-sandbox** is an experimental platform for automating and managing AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform. This repository aims to learn by creating Terraform scripts using generative AI and experimenting with building cloud infrastructure.

It provides scripts for safe experimentation with real AWS environments using various Terraform templates and scripts. It also includes guidelines for designing and implementing infrastructure using generative AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox.git
   cd aws-terraform-sandbox
   ```

2. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure your credentials.

3. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

4. Navigate to the desired sandbox environment:
   ```
   cd sandbox/s01_streamlit_aws_setup
   ```

5. Initialize and run Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Enter `yes` at the prompt to confirm.

7. Once deployment is complete, access the public IP address provided in the output to check the Streamlit application.

8. After finishing your work, always run the following command to delete the resources:
   ```
   terraform destroy
   ```
   Enter `yes` at the prompt to confirm.

> [!WARNING]
> The `terraform destroy` command will delete all AWS resources you have created. Before running it, ensure you don't have any data you want to keep.

## 📝 Updates

- 🎉 [v1.1.1](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.1.1) : Improved documentation and style changes.
- 🎉 [v1.1.0](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.1.0) : Adjustments to the header image generation algorithm.

## 🤖 Generative AI Utilization

This repository uses generative AI to create Terraform scripts. The requirement definition document for designing and implementing infrastructure using generative AI is available at [docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md). By referring to this document, you can learn how to effectively utilize generative AI to build AWS resources.
