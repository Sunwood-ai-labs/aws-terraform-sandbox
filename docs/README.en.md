## 🌟 Getting Started

**aws-terraform-sandbox** is an experimental platform for automating and managing the infrastructure of AWS cloud environments using Terraform. This repository aims to learn by experimenting with the creation of Terraform scripts using generative AI, and building cloud infrastructure.

We provide scripts that allow you to safely experiment with real AWS environments using various Terraform templates and scripts. The repository also includes guidelines for designing and implementing infrastructure using generative AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox.git
   cd aws-terraform-sandbox
   ```

2. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure your credentials.

3. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

4. Navigate to the desired sandbox environment:
   ```
   cd sandbox/s01_streamlit_aws_setup
   ```

5. Initialize and run Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Type `yes` when prompted to confirm.

7. Once deployment is complete, access the provided public IP address to view the Streamlit application.

8. When you are finished, be sure to run the following command to delete the resources:
   ```
   terraform destroy
   ```
   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm.

> [!WARNING]
> The `terraform destroy` command will delete all AWS resources you have created. Please ensure there is no data you want to keep before running it.

## 🛠 Sandbox Environments

This repository includes the following sandbox environments:

1. **s01_streamlit_aws_setup**: Sets up AWS infrastructure for deploying a basic Streamlit application.

2. **s02_streamlit_aws_deployer**: Sets up AWS infrastructure to deploy Streamlit applications with more advanced settings, including automatic start/stop schedules.

3. **s03_ec2_aws_visual**: Creates an EC2 instance and its associated resources (VPC, subnets, security groups, etc.) and provides tools for visualizing them.
    - 🎉 **EC2 instance and associated resource visualization features**
    - 🎉 **Automatic generation of AWS configuration diagrams using generative AI**

For details on each sandbox environment, please refer to [sandbox/README.md](sandbox/README.md).

## 🤖 Generative AI Usage

This repository utilizes generative AI to create Terraform scripts. The requirements definition document for using generative AI to design and implement infrastructure can be found at [docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md). By referring to this document, you can learn how to effectively leverage generative AI to build AWS resources.
