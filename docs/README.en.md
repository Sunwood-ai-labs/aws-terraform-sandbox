## 🌟 Getting Started

**aws-terraform-sandbox** is an experimental platform designed for automating and managing the infrastructure of AWS cloud environments using Terraform. This repository aims to learn by experimenting with building cloud infrastructure using Terraform scripts generated by generative AI.

We provide various Terraform templates and scripts that allow you to safely experiment with real AWS environments. Additionally, it includes guidelines for designing and implementing infrastructure using generative AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox.git
   cd aws-terraform-sandbox
   ```

2. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure your credentials.

3. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

4. Navigate to the desired sandbox environment:
   ```
   cd sandbox/s01_streamlit_aws_setup
   ```

5. Initialize and run Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Enter `yes` when prompted to confirm.

7. Once deployment is complete, access the public IP address provided in the output to view your Streamlit application.

8. After finishing your work, always run the following command to delete the resources:
   ```
   terraform destroy
   ```
   Enter `yes` when prompted to confirm.

> [!WARNING]
> The `terraform destroy` command will delete all created AWS resources. Please ensure there is no data you wish to keep before running it.

## 🛠 Sandbox Environments

This repository includes the following sandbox environments:

1. **s01_streamlit_aws_setup**: Sets up an AWS infrastructure to deploy a basic Streamlit application.

2. **s02_streamlit_aws_deployer**: Deploys a Streamlit application with more advanced settings, including an AWS infrastructure with an automated start/stop schedule.

For detailed information on each sandbox environment, refer to [sandbox/README.md](sandbox/README.md).

- [v1.0.0](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.0.0) : Streamlined the organization of the scripts.

## 🤖 Generative AI Utilization

This repository utilizes generative AI for creating Terraform scripts. The requirements definition document for using generative AI to design and implement infrastructure can be found at [docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md). By referring to this document, you can learn how to effectively leverage generative AI to build AWS resources.
