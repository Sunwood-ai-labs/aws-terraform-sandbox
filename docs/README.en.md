## 🌟 Getting Started

**aws-terraform-sandbox** is an experimental platform designed for automating and managing AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform. This repository aims to leverage generative AI to create Terraform scripts, allowing you to learn and experiment with building cloud infrastructure through trial and error.

We provide a variety of Terraform templates and scripts that enable safe experimentation within a real AWS environment. We also include guidelines for designing and implementing infrastructure using generative AI.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox.git
   cd aws-terraform-sandbox
   ```

2. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure your credentials.

3. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

4. Navigate to your desired sandbox environment:
   ```bash
   cd sandbox/s01_streamlit_aws_setup
   ```

5. Initialize and run Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

6. When prompted, type `yes` to confirm.

7. After deployment, access the provided public IP address to check your Streamlit application.

8. When you are finished, always run the following commands to delete the resources:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
   Type `yes` at the confirmation prompt.

> [!WARNING]
> The `terraform destroy` command will delete all the AWS resources you have created. Make sure there's no data you want to keep before running it.

## 🛠 Sandbox Environments

This repository contains the following sandbox environments:

1. **s01_streamlit_aws_setup**: Sets up an AWS infrastructure to deploy a basic Streamlit application.

2. **s02_streamlit_aws_deployer**: Deploys a Streamlit application with advanced configurations and sets up an AWS infrastructure that includes automated startup/shutdown scheduling.

For more information on each sandbox environment, refer to [sandbox/README.md](sandbox/README.md).

## 📝 Updates

- 🎉 [v1.2.0](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.2.0) : Added Terraform configurations for Streamlit application deployment.
- 🎉 [v1.1.1](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.1.1) : Improved documentation and style adjustments.
- 🎉 [v1.1.0](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.1.0) : Adjusted header image generation algorithm.
- [v1.0.0](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/aws-terraform-sandbox/releases/tag/v1.0.0) : Enhanced maintenance scripts.

## 🤖 Generative AI Utilization

This repository utilizes generative AI to create Terraform scripts. The requirements definition document for using generative AI to design and implement infrastructure can be found in [docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS_DEFINITION.md). By referring to this document, you can learn how to effectively leverage generative AI to build AWS resources.
